Generic instruction:

* When discussing software architecture always go step by step, never come up with a complete solution when not explicitly asked.
* Be as concise as possible with your answers, typically no more than a few sentences.
* When giving code example, make them as small as possible to explain the concept or relevant change.
* Always start with the most simple implementation first

Coding instructions:

* Use self explanatory names for variables, functions, methods, classes etc.
* Don't add comments or docstrings to explain what the code does. Instead, make the code self explanatory.
* Make things as simple as possible, only support use cases that are actually needed
